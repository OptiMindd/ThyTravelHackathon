# Airline Flight Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning
The project is created in the THY Travel Hackhathon 2023 as the proof of concept that suggests
reinforcement learning can be a good choice in solving the problem of airline scheduling.

## Problem
Airline companies how to deal with management of hundreds of planes and thousands of passengers each day.
In order to maximize the profit planes should always be full. This makes the very hard optimization problem.

## Our suggestion
Reinforcement learning has already proved its ability in dealing with optimization problem. Airline scheduling must be flexible
since the numbers of passengers desiring to travel is affected by many factor. Being a model free algorithm, RL can handle
different situations. Its negative side is that it requires a robust simulation environment.

## Steps in the development
- Collecting data from the API`s served by Turkish Airlines.
- Creation of a airline and airplane simulation with possible passenger counts.
- Implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithm on the simulation environment.
- Tuning parameters for better results.
